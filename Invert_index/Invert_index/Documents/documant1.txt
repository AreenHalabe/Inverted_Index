Artificial intelligence (AI) might be the most important technology we ever develop. Ensuring it is safe and used beneficially is one of the best ways we can safeguard the long-term future.
Despite these impressive accomplishments, AIs don’t always do what we want them to. When OpenAI trained an agent to play CoastRunners, they rewarded it for increasing its points, expecting to incentivise it to finish the race as fast as possible. 
Amazon used an AI to screen resumés, thinking this would increase the fairness and efficiency of their hiring process. Instead, they discovered the AI was biased against women. It penalised resumés containing words like "women's" and "netball," while favouring language more frequently used by men, such as "executed" and "captured." This was not intended, but that may be of little comfort to the women whose applications were rejected because of their gender.
